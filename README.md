# üìö Natural Language Processing (NLP) Concepts & Implementations

Welcome to this repository, a comprehensive resource for exploring fundamental concepts and practical implementations in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. This repository serves as a learning hub for my professional elective at university, aiming to demystify key NLP techniques through both theoretical explanations and hands-on Python code.

-----

## üéØ Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to:

  * **Deepen understanding:** Provide clear, concise explanations of core NLP algorithms and methodologies.
  * **Bridge theory and practice:** Offer executable Python code that demonstrates how these concepts are applied.
  * **Build a practical resource:** Serve as a reference for common NLP tasks and techniques.

-----

## üìÇ Repository Structure

This repository is organized to facilitate easy navigation and learning:

  * **`/concepts`**: This directory contains Markdown (`.md`) files, each dedicated to explaining a specific NLP concept. These files delve into the theory, formulas, and intuition behind each technique.
      * Example: `concepts/TF-IDF.md`
  * **`/implementations`**: This directory houses Python (`.py`) files, providing practical, often step-by-step, code implementations of the concepts discussed in the `/concepts` directory. Where applicable, these implementations will also demonstrate the use of popular NLP libraries.
      * Example: `implementations/tf_idf_implementation.py`

## ‚ú® Featured Concepts & Implementations

Here's a glimpse of what you'll find in this repository. More concepts and implementations will be added as the course progresses\!

### **Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)**

  * **Concept:** A numerical statistic reflecting how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. It's widely used for information retrieval and text mining.
  * **Explanation:** [`concepts/TF-IDF.md`](https://www.google.com/search?q=./concepts/TF-IDF.md)
  * **Implementation:** [`implementations/tf_idf_implementation.py`](https://www.google.com/search?q=./implementations/tf_idf_implementation.py)
      * This implementation showcases a **manual calculation** of TF-IDF, breaking down each step (tokenization, TF, IDF, and TF-IDF aggregation).
      * It also demonstrates how to leverage `scikit-learn`'s **`TfidfVectorizer`** for a more streamlined approach.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To explore the code and concepts in this repository:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

    (Remember to replace `your-username/your-repo-name.git` with your actual repository path.)

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    The Python implementations may require specific libraries. It's recommended to set up a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt # (You'll need to create this file based on your code's imports)
    ```

    For the current TF-IDF example, you would need `pandas` and `scikit-learn`:

    ```bash
    pip install pandas scikit-learn
    ```

3.  **Explore the content:**

      * Navigate to the `/concepts` directory to read the theoretical explanations.
      * Head to the `/implementations` directory to run and understand the code examples.
