# 📚 Understanding TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)

TF-IDF is a numerical statistic used in text mining and natural language processing to measure the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents (corpus). It's widely used for tasks like information retrieval, document similarity, and feature extraction for machine learning models.

## 🔍 What is TF-IDF?

TF-IDF combines two metrics:

### 1️⃣ Term Frequency (TF)
Represents how often a word appears in a document.

**Formula:**

$\text{TF}(t) = \frac{\text{Number of times term } t \text{ appears in a document}}{\text{Total terms in the document}}$

### 2️⃣ Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)
Measures how significant a word is across multiple documents.

**Formula:**

$\text{IDF}(t) = \log \left( \frac{\text{Total number of documents}}{\text{Number of documents with term } t} \right)$

Words that appear in many documents (like "the", "is", "and") get lower IDF scores. Rare words get higher scores.

### 🔗 TF-IDF Score

$\text{TF-IDF}(t) = \text{TF}(t) \times \text{IDF}(t)$

This score tells us how important a term is in a particular document while accounting for its overall frequency in the corpus.

## 🛠 Implementation Approaches

### 🧠 Manual Calculation
We break down each step:
- Tokenization
- Frequency counting
- TF computation
- IDF computation
- Final TF-IDF aggregation

This helps demystify the math behind the technique.

### ⚙️ Using scikit-learn's `TfidfVectorizer`
A convenient tool that handles preprocessing, stopword removal, and TF-IDF calculation automatically.

## 📊 Example

**Document A**: "the man went out for a walk" 
**Document B**: "the children sat around the fire"

After processing, we obtain the TF-IDF values for each word in both documents, highlighting which words are more descriptive or unique.

## 🌟 Why It’s Useful

TF-IDF helps:
- Filter out common, less informative words
- Highlight key terms in documents
- Improve text-based machine learning models by giving meaningful features
